College essays can be a way to display your writing skills and where
your personality and voice can shine. Essays can be a lot of pressure
especially with the word limits and to get started with an idea or
topic which you are passionate to write about.

1.  Try to go places where you find the most inspiration for ideas and
    remember to brainstorm them and write about them later. The
    greatest ideas often come when you least expect them so make sure
    to write them down so you don't
    [forget](http://www.lawrence.edu/).

2.  Read your work aloud so you can improve upon it if your writing is
    [flat](https://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2016/10/19/college-admission-essays-ive-heard-that-one-before/).
    That seems like common sense but many people forget to. Along
    these lines, is making sure you have someone else edit your essay
    such as a teacher or college counselor to avoid simple grammar
    mistakes.

3.  Many warn against trying to be funny in your
    [essay](https://www.princetonreview.com/college-advice/college-essay).
    Everyone has different comedic values so what you think is funny
    probably won't be to an admissions officer. Also make sure to
    stick to answering the questions, don't stray to talking about
    your grades or test scores.

4.  It is time to focus on yourself and be
    [self-centered](https://admissions.tufts.edu/blogs/inside-admissions/post/the-only-four-college-essay-writing-tips-youll-ever-need/).
    This means to write about your own personality, passions, or
    quirks instead of someone else or an experience. You could use
    experiences to describe yourself or how you have grown but zone in
    on discussing yourself.

5.  Focus on details and go deep into the things you write rather than
    being so broad. This can show how passionate you are about some
    writer or some art piece or anything like that.

6.  Write your essay the way you would speak. You often need proof of
    how you may describe your personality and the way to do this is
    through your writing. Make sure your written tone matches your
    spoken one. How you describe yourself should make sense on paper
    if someone who has never met you were to read your essay.

7.  Write from a unique perspective and try to avoid writing how people
    normally would. It should be based upon genuine emotion and
    authentic experiences. Open your essay strong so that it is exciting and so an admissions officer can be intrigued.

8.  Start writing your essay as early as possible so you can have
    multiple drafts and really have time to think through how you want
    to express yourself. Thoughtful responses take time.

To close off here are some of the tips to **start** writing your
college essay that the
[college board](https://blog.collegeboard.org/how-write-college-application-essay)
describes.

-   If asked to write about a personal experience, an achievement, or a
    person who is significant to you make sure to go beyond the what
    or the who and dig into the how and the why.

-   When writing about a trip or an event, describe how the experience
    affected you and why it's meaningful to you.

-   If you are writing about a person in your life, be personal and
    specific, not just sentimental. Explain what this person did and
    how their actions, words, or example affected you.
