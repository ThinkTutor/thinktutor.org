The pandemic has obviously affected everyone's day to day lives and activities, but particularly the educational system has been adapted to accommodate online learning. The sudden shift to remote instruction has reinforced the idea that developing high quality online teaching and learning takes time, effort, and planning, which some may argue the pandemic [did not allow for](https://www.educationnext.org/covid-19-boost-online-learning-may-backfire/). The real question to ask is how has COVID potentially changed the educational system in the United States for the long term?

## Increased use of online tools

Many more students across the country may have laptops and internet
access, so there may be an increased use of online tools. Now that
students may have experience with these online tools, teachers will also
have an easier time using them, so they may resort to them. [Online
tools have been shown to
be](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/business/online-learning-virus.html)
very helpful complements to in person teaching, and can allow teachers
to devote their attention to mentoring and engaging students. However,
the main concerns with this supposed positive tool can be that these
online tools become a replacement to in-person instruction as well as
the digital divide between [schools and communities](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/03/17/what-the-coronavirus-reveals-about-the-digital-divide-between-schools-and-communities/).

## Risk of disadvantaged and vulnerable children of dropping out as well as many more challenges

If these online tools do become more normalized there will be
disproportionate effects for kids with disadvantaged backgrounds vs the
privileged. There may be increased challenges for kids without resources
such as laptops. PISA has found that in the US
[25%](http://www.oecd.org/pisa) of those from
disadvantaged backgrounds did not have a computer to work from whereas
all 15 year olds from a privileged background did. These inequalities
may affect these children in the long run, especially as online learning
becomes more common. Research on chronic absenteeism as well as remote
learning has shown that there must be adequate support to these
disadvantaged children who are the least equipped and at risk of
becoming disengaged with [content and dropping out](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-consequences-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-for-education-performance-and-equity-in-the-united-states-what-can-we-learn-from-pre-pandemic-research-to-inform-relief-recovery-and-rebuilding/).

## Removal of standardized tests such as the ACT or SAT

The pandemic also illustrated the limitations of standardized tests,
which can reward affluent students who have access to better specialized
instruction that only demonstrate a small set of skills. Many colleges
around the country have made sending ACT/SAT scores optional.

Investing in the future of children with lost learning and teachers devoting their time to them
===============================================================================================

Many schools and colleges around the country must help students with
their lost

learning. The coronavirus rescue package includes \$123 billion for
public K-12 schools, and districts are required to spend at least 20
percent of their funding on

evidence-based interventions to address learning loss. Many students do
not learn well digitally as well as the circumstances made it difficult
to retain the information they did

learn which has led to them [falling behind](https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/students-falling-behind/2020/12/06/88d7157a-3665-11eb-8d38-6aea1adb3839_story.html).
Research proves that the most vulnerable students have had a sharp
increase in failing grades, so teachers must devote their attention
especially to them otherwise dropout rates may increase. The
highest-quality and paid teachers must serve the neediest students in
order to come back from this.

The educational system has fallen backwards, but Biden argues that the
rescue package will help [move it forwards](https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/see-what-the-huge-covid-19-aid-deal-biden-has-signed-means-for-education-in-two-charts/2021/03).

## Hardships in the classroom including attention and focus

[Kids across the country](https://www.unicef.org/georgia/stories/how-covid-19-changed-lives-voices-children) agree that the pandemic led to their daily lives and activities to be
radically changed, and with this change comes the fear that they won't
be able to go back to their normal, busy schedules. The other concern is
if they will be able to sit through lectures without being unfocused and
able to follow along. A study done on the "Effects of COVID-19 on
College Students' Mental Health in the United States"
[revealed](https://www.jmir.org/2020/9/e21279/) that many
students have difficulty in concentrating as well as increased concerns
about their academic performance. Clearly, students returning to
in-person college classes may need extra time adjusting and help in
certain concepts.

## Active steps to support the well-being of students in order to succeed academically

There have also been multiple
[studies](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0245327)
providing evidence of the psychological impacts from COVID-19 among
university students. These include higher levels of anxiety, depression,
substance abuse, and disordered eating compared to the general
population. These mental health challenges could have long term
consequences on their education and futures. The study points out some
very important takeaways which include that students' basic
physiological and psychological needs must be met before focusing on and
excelling in academic life. They recommend that university
administrators take active steps to support the mental health and
educational success of their students especially following the pandemic.
Mental health is a priority and in order for students across America to
achieve academic success, the educational system must be understanding
of the worries of many students and give them the support they may need.
